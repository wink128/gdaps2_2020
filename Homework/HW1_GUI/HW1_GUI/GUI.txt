I wanted to make this so that it was like a planner and you can add assignments to it and it would save in the calendar 
and if you hovered over the date it would show if you had an assignment that day or not. If you click the clear button 
it would clear all the words you entered and the selections you made. If you clicked save it would saveI couldn't figure 
out how any of it worked. That's entirely my fault I thought I had more time than I did but a lot was going on.

To kill the program just click the X button.
