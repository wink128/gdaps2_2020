I wanted to make this so that it was like a planner and you can add assignments to it and it would save in the calendar 
and if you hovered over the date it would show if you had an assignment that day or not but I couldn't figure out how
it worked. That's entirely my fault I thought I had more time than I did but a lot was going on.
